    <h2>What the show is all about</h2>
    Game of Thrones is an HBO series that tells the
    story of a medieval country's civil war. The
    series, which premiered in April 2011, is set on
    the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos in a
    world where seasons stretch on for years. When the
    story begins, a decade-long summer is ending, and
    winter looms as characters battle to claim the
    "Iron Throne," the seat of the king of the Seven
    Kingdoms, the regime that rules all but the
    northern tip of Westeros. In show parlance, "sit on
    the Iron Throne" is a metonym equivalent to "rule
    Westeros."

    <h2>The Plot</h2>
    The show is divided into three major plot lines.
    The first covers the battle between the lords of
    the continent of Westeros — most notably members of
    the Baratheon, Lannister, and Stark families — who
    are involved in the fight for the Iron Throne. The
    second follows the rise of Daenerys Targaryen, the
    last member of an exiled family as she builds an
    army in Essos to reclaim the throne. The third plot
    takes place in the North of Westeros among the
    Night's Watch, an armed unit that guards the
    300-mile-long, 70-foot-tall wall that protects the
    rest of the continent from the mythical creatures
    that lurk there.
